# Hardware Requirements and Setup

## Practical Implementation Guide

Welcome to the hardware requirements section! This comprehensive guide helps you set up the appropriate hardware configuration for following along with the humanoid robotics educational book. Whether you're a student, researcher, educator, or hobbyist, you'll find setup options that fit your budget and learning goals.

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

We understand that not everyone has access to the same hardware resources. That's why we've designed multiple learning paths to accommodate different budgets and access levels:

- **🏠 Home Learning Setup**: Minimal hardware for individual learners
- **🎓 Educational Lab Setup**: Mid-range hardware for educational institutions
- **🔬 Research Setup**: Advanced hardware for research and development
- **☁️ Cloud-Based Setup**: No hardware required - learn in the cloud
- **💰 Budget-Friendly Options**: Low-cost alternatives and DIY solutions
